Building a docker image with the following repo results in file merge conflict

* Debug with docker-compose
#+begin_src shell
docker-compose run --rm debug
git clone https://github.com/dimitar-petrov/pants_merge_debug.git
cd pants_merge_debug
./pants package py/apps/pyapp/docker:docker_src
#+end_src

* Debug without docker-compose

*Command*
#+begin_src shell
./pants package py/apps/pyapp/docker:docker_src
#+end_src

*Output*
#+begin_example
12:40:26.87 [WARN] The target py/libs/pybind/setup.py:pybind0 imports `pytest`, but Pants cannot safely infer a dependency because more than one target owns this module, so it is ambiguous which to use: ['py/libs/nufft#pytest', 'py/libs/pybind#pytest'].

Please explicitly include the dependency you want in the `dependencies` field of py/libs/pybind/setup.py:pybind0, or ignore the ones you do not want by prefixing with `!` or `!!` so that one or no targets are left.

Alternatively, you can remove the ambiguity by deleting/changing some of the targets so that only 1 target owns this module. Refer to https://www.pantsbuild.org/v2.12/docs/troubleshooting#import-errors-and-missing-dependencies.
